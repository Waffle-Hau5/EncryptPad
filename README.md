# -----EncryptPad v1-----
-A python notepad application with great encryption features using Fernet (symmetric encryption). 

-A default key is hardcoded.

-New encryption key generation for added security and advanced users.

-GUI

-Encrypt, decrypt, save, and load options/buttons.

-Can be used to store sensitive information in a secure manor. 

-If you do decide to generate a new encryption key, make sure you document it for later use, most secure would be to write it down, as that is the only way you can decrypt the text again.

IN VERSION 2:

Add a more user friendly interface.

Better GUI design.

An executable for Linux, macOS and Windows.

An option to encrypt entire files.

The beta is broken, but will have many other features in the future.
